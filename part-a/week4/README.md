# Implementing Prim Minimum spanning tree algorithm

Update your Homework 2 graph class to add two more methods. Add a constructor that can read in a graph from a file. The file format will be an initial integer that is the node size of the graph and the further values will be integer triples: (i, j, cost). See Sample Test Data.

Implement either the Prim or Kruskal Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm. These algorithms are similar in flavor to Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path algorithm. Links to these algorithms are provided besides being explained in the videos.

The output for MST should be the cost and the tree (the edges).  The input will be provided on the website.
